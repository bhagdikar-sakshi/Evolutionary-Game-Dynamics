Evolutionary Game Theory is based on the foundations of traditional game theory, but it focuses on evolving populations rather than isolated decision-making scenarios.
Replicator dynamics is a mathematical framework used in EGT to model how strategies change in frequency over time as more successful strategies tend to proliferate within a population.
It provides a framework to study the dynamics of strategies and their evolution in populations, offering insights into the emergence and stability of behaviors in different contexts.
This repository contains an exploration of some of the novel ideas in the field and their implementation.
